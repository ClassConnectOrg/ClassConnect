<p class="courseblockdesc">
Drexel University is one of over 100 institutions associated with the Science Education Alliance – Phage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) program funded through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). This means that in the Honors section of Introductory Biology, we have a new scientific discovery-driven research based lab component to discover and analyze new bacteriophage viruses. There are approximately 1031 bacteriophages in the world and we can help understand their evolution, their diversity, and their functional roles (medical, environmental, ecological) through contributing the data on the phage we discover to this growing database. This laboratory course is part of a sequence of three introductory courses.<br />

<p class="courseblockdesc">
This course will allow students to experience scientific discovery-driven research, using bioinformatics to annotate bacteriophage genomes. Student will examine phage genomes to identify gene start sites, assign gene functions to individual phages. Phage genomes will be compared to investigate shared and unique regions of the genomes and shared and unique gene functions. As a result of this course, the bacteriophage annotations will be made available through the open access database GenBank.

Connections in Biology is an open enrollment course which will give students the opportunity to make exactly that: connections. Building upon a new theme in biology each week, students will connect that material to their current Philadelphia community as well as to their future professional and personal pursuits. The course is designed on the Community Based Learning platform (CBL) and is scheduled to meet twice a week: one meeting will be a formal lecture on campus and one meeting will be at a partnered middle school with the instructor and Drexel students leading an 9 week after school science club.

Students in this course will explore the privilege of aging and ways to do it well with senior members of the Philadelphia community. There will be 2 class meetings each week, one on campus and one at a designated senior citizen facility. In addition to the academic underpinnings of the biology of aging, the course will provide the students with intergenerational interactions, as well as opportunities to connect the experience with their academic path at Drexel and their future professional plans.<br />

This course is designed to give students an understanding of the established fundamentals and principles of histology. Histology lies at the interface between cell biology and physiology: here we examine how cells work together as tissues and organs to create a functional pump (the heart), filters (the kidneys), and bellows (the lungs). While considerable focus will be on the structural details of select systems, there are recurring patterns that emerge in tissue construction. These patterns reflect regional variations in the functional role of the assembled tissue; studying these principles offers us a view of how small differences in cell number, type, and interaction can lead to the wide variety of tissue/organ properties seen in the human body.<br />

Autism disorders arise from changes in neurodevelopment that deeply affect how individuals interact with the world around them. As study of autism has increased over the past several decades, it has become clear that autism actually comprises a large, heterogeneous set of similar disorders, most of which are genetic in origin. In this class, we will study how neuronal cell biology is disrupted in known forms of autism, and how distinct forms of autism can arise from alterations in common cellular pathways. Further, we will discuss how these discoveries may lead to eventual treatments or cures.<br />

This course is designed to give students an appreciation of the many ways to think about the diseased organism, with an emphasis on the cellular- and systems-level malfunctions that contribute to the disease state. Having established an understanding of the normal physiology of the system in question, we will investigate the underlying cause, origin, and symptoms of the pathophysiology, as well as exploring the successes and limitations of available treatment options. Considerable emphasis will be placed on the importance of model systems that mimic aspects of the diseased state, as well as the role epidemiological data plays in helping to clarify the genetic and environmental contributors.<br />

		<h3>Writing-intensive Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to graduate, all students must pass three writing-intensive courses after their freshman year. Two writing-intensive courses must be in a student's major. The third can be in any discipline. Students are advised to take one writing-intensive class each year, beginning with the sophomore year, and to avoid “clustering” these courses near the end of their matriculation. Transfer students need to meet with an academic advisor to review the number of writing-intensive courses required to graduate.</p>
		<p>For additional information, and an up-to-date list of the writing-intensive courses being offered, students should check the Drexel University Writing Center page</p>
